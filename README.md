## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts â€“ [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) (weights: 500, 800)
- Bootstrap 5.3

### What I learned

This project helped me practice:

- Creating clean card layouts using Flexbox
- Using custom fonts and font weights effectively
- Styling with `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `hsl()` colors
- Hosting a project with GitHub Pages

```css
.main {
  border: 1.5px solid black;
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 black;
  border-radius: 15px;
}
